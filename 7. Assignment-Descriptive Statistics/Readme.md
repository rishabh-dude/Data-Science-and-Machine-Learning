Assignment-Descriptive Statistics

A test series of cricket matches will soon occur in England in the winter. In order to choose the best squad members for the game, the captain of the Indian team must consult with a data scientist because he is unable to manually sort through the data. Data scientists gather each player's prior match results, then analyze the data and identify the top players for Team India.

About the dataset
    The data contains 3 columns and 9 rows such as Batter 1 Score, Batter 2 Score, and Temperature(during the game).
Batter 1 Score: The batter 1 score column contains past scores in numerical values,
Batter 2 Score: The batter 2 score column contains past scores in numerical values,
Temperature: The temperature column contains temperature during the game.

Expected outcomes
Your job as a data scientist is to use the data given, analyze two players' past performances in different weather conditions using statistical analysis and data visualization in Python, and then identify the most effective player name (batsmen). Give the right reasoning for your choice.
